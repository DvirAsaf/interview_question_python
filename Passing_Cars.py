Task description
A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.
The consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.
Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:
0 represents a car traveling east,
1 represents a car traveling west.
The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q),
where 0 ≤ P < Q < N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.
For example, consider array A such that:
  A[0] = 0
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 0
  A[3] = 1
  A[4] = 1
We have five pairs of passing cars: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4).
Write a function:
that, given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the number of pairs of passing cars.
The function should return −1 if the number of pairs of passing cars exceeds 1,000,000,000.
For example, given:
  A[0] = 0
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 0
  A[3] = 1
  A[4] = 1
the function should return 5, as explained above.
