"""
question: create new data structure that have the following methods:
        1) get(key) - the method get a key and return the correct value if exist else null.
        2) set(key, value) - the method get new key and value pair then enter them to the data structure.
        3) set_all(value) - the method gets value and changes all values of the data structure to this value.
        **** all the methods need to run in time complexity of O(1). (NOT approximately but rather exactly O(1)).
